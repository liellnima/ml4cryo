# Machine Learning for the Cryosphere: A Literature Overview
This is an open-source collection of relevant literature within ML for Cryospheric Sciences.

Please navigate to the project page. Here you can find a structured overview of our current state of literature review.

Everything else in this README refers to that project page.

##  How to add a publication

**TLDR: Open an issue, I'll add you, you can add your publication. Do not add new items to the colored items.**

1. Open an issue naming that you want to be added to the project/repo. State how you want to contribute. I will add you so you get write access.
2. Add a publication you have found. Please add as many of the visible fields as possible.
- The field `status`: Use the tag "newly added" here, so we know we have to review it.
- The field `assignee`: Put your own github user handle here. This way we know who added that item. We will assign a reviewer to it.
-  The field `cryo area`: This one is important. Please choose one of the areas that are already there. Don't add a new one - open an issue if you think there should be another area added here.
- The field `task`: Same as for "cryo area"
- The field `type of data`: If you do not find it in the drop-down menu, just add the type of data used here. Keep it general though. Instead of saying 'SNOWPACK data', use something like: 'snow model', such that other snowpack models are included in that area as well.
3. You are done - thank you for contributing! If you are contributing significantly to this project we will reach out to you and speak about how to credit your work (e.g. acknowledgements or authorship).

## How to gain insights
You can download the data and perform your data analysis on it.
You can look at the charts (e.g. number of counts for each cryo area)

## How to cite us
Please cite us if you use our work. There will be a literature overview publication that can be cited.
